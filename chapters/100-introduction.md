# Introduction

This is the beginning of a work-in-progress book, *Learning
TidalCycles*. It is currently being developed alongside the *Tidal
Club* online course, also with financial help from [ko-fi
supporters](https://ko-fi.com/yaxulive).

Please note that this is a work in progress, and you might find it a
difficult journey, with beginner material mixed with advanced
topics. Please skip bits that don't yet make sense - sections will be
re-ordered as things develop..

## What is TidalCycles? 

TidalCycles, or just _Tidal_ for short, is a language environment for
exploring algorithmic pattern. It is known as a live coding
environment (see below), and often used in dance music contexts, but
really can be applied to anything pattern-related, whether repetitive
dance music, abstract minimalist music, weird electroacoustic music,
or outside the world of music completely - people have used Tidal to
make video art, choreograph dance, and even pattern textiles with
algorithms.

The concept of _algorithmic pattern_ is central to Tidal, so let's
have a go at defining what it means. In music, any sequence is often
called a pattern, if it gets _repeated_. But there is a lot more to
pattern than repetition. Think about patterns in textiles - you get a
lot of repeating patterns, but also patterns of _reflection_ or
_rotation_ creating symmetry, _fractal_ patterns playing with
similarity at different scales, _interference_ patterns between
different elements. You also get _glitches_ in patterns, where
expectations set up by other kinds of pattern are confounded through
'errors', often introduced on purpose. All these kinds of patternings
can be explored with Tidal, and more. With "algorithmic pattern" I
focus on the way a pattern is _perceived_, in particular how the
movement and processes transformation can be perceived in the end
results.

In summary, an algorithmic pattern is where you see, hear or otherwise
perceive ways of making.

## Live coding and embracing error

Live coding, as a community and movement, has been around since around
the year 2000, giving itself the name [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org/) at
the first international meeting in Hamburg in 2004. As a practice,
live coding arose from a few different places at once, perhaps in
reaction to the increasingly slick 'seamlessness' of music software,
alongside a resurgence of 'creative coding' as a means to make art. We
asked ourselves, instead of using prewritten software in the studio,
why not write software from scratch on stage?  A pretty strange idea,
but it worked out pretty well; live coding has turned into a
world-wide movement, with a wide range of live coding environments and
technologies for the live performing arts.^[Check the long list of
technologies in the TOPLAP "All things Live Coding" page here:

Tidal was originally made for live coding, but that does not have to
involve being in front of a live audience. Many prefer to write code
alone in the studio, and only share it if/when they feel it is
ready. They might then perform with it by manipulating and tweaking
the code, rather than writing it from scratch, or just use live coding
tools as an expressive way to produce recorded music. All of this is
of course completely fine, it is totally up to you how you fit Tidal
into your creative workflow and life in general.

Still, Tidal's focus on patternings does encourage a certain kind of
approach. If you come to Tidal with fixed ideas, you might get
frustrated. When you are working with pattern, you might have three or
four layers of manipulations going on, resulting in strange
interactions that can make it difficult to predict exactly what will
happen when you make a change on a particular layer. However if you
are happy to embrace a little uncertainty, you will get a tacit
understanding for Tidal patterns, and get a feel for high level
control of its expansive possibilities.
