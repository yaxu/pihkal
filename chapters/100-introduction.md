# Introduction

This is the beginning of a work-in-progress book, *Learning
TidalCycles*. 

This is something I've wanted to write for a long time - a complete
guide to TidalCycles. I can't promise that I'll ever finish it, but
you can make that much more likely by **sending me some coffee**! You
can do that here, either one-off or on a regular basis:
[https://ko-fi.com/yaxulive/](https://ko-fi.com/yaxulive/). All coffee
is much appreciated.

Whether or not you can send coffee, **please send feedback!** I'd be
very happy to receive all comments, about what is good, what is bad,
and ideas for topics. You can reach me e.g. on
[https://forum.toplap.org/t/tidalcycles-the-book/](the forum -
https://forum.toplap.org/t/tidalcycles-the-book/), by email
([mailto:alex@slab.org](alex@slab.org), or on the TOPLAP chat
([https://chat.toplap.org/channel/tidal-doc](https://chat.toplap.org/channel/tidal-doc)
as 'yaxu').

## What is TidalCycles? 

TidalCycles, or just _Tidal_ for short, is a language environment for
exploring pattern. It's known as a live coding environment (see
below), and often used in dance music contexts, but really can be
applied to anything pattern-related, whether repetitive dance music,
abstract minimalist music, weird electroacoustic music, or outside the
world of music completely - people have used Tidal to make video art,
choreograph dance, and even pattern textiles.

Pattern is central to Tidal, so lets have a go at defining it. In
music, any sequence is often called a 'pattern', if it gets
_repeated_. But there's a lot more to pattern than repetition. Think
about patterns in textiles - you get a lot of repeating patterns, but
also patterns of _reflection_ or _rotation_ creating symmetry,
_fractal_ patterns playing with similarity at different scales,
_interference_ patterns between different elements. You also get
_glitches_ in patterns, where expectations set up by other kinds of
pattern are confounded through 'errors', often introduced on
purpose. All these kinds of patternings can be explored with Tidal,
and more.

## Live coding and embracing error

Live coding, as a community and movement, has been around since around
the year 2000, giving itself the name TOPLAP at the first
international meeting in Hamburg in 2004. As a practice, live coding
arose from a few different places at once, perhaps in reaction to the
increasingly slick 'seamlessness' of music software, as well as a
resurgence of 'creative coding' as a means to make art. We asked
ourselves, instead of using prewritten software in the studio, why not
write software from scratch on stage?  A pretty strange idea, but it
worked out pretty well, live coding has turned into a world-wide
movement, with a wide range of live coding environments and
technologies for the live performing arts.^[Check the long list of
technologies in the TOPLAP "All things Live Coding" page here:

Tidal was originally made for live coding, but that doesn't have to
involve being in front of a live audience. Many prefer to write code
alone in the studio, and only share it if/when they feel it's
ready. They might then perform with it by manipulating and tweaking
the code, rather than writing it from scratch, or just use live coding
tools as an expressive way to produce recorded music. All of this is
of course completely fine, it's totally up to you how you fit Tidal
into your creative workflow and life in general.

Still, Tidal's focus on patternings does encourage a certain kind of
approach. If you come to Tidal with fixed ideas, you might get
frustrated. When you're working with pattern, you might have three or
four layers of manipulations going on, resulting in strange
interactions that can make it difficult to predict exactly what will
happen when you make a change on a particular layer. However if you're
happy to embrace a little uncertainty, you'll get a tacit
understanding for Tidal patterns, and get a feel for high level
control of its expansive possibilities.
